        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Energetic and detail-oriented <strong>Software Developer</strong> with 3+ years of hands-on experience
            building web, desktop, and cloud-based applications. Skilled in transforming complex requirements
            into clean, scalable solutions. Proven track record in full project ownership — from backend APIs
            to frontend interfaces and cloud deployment — delivering reliable systems in both team and solo environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            In recent freelance work, I’ve helped clients bring their ideas to life by delivering secure, full-featured web apps built with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>, tailored to their specific business needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of coding, I’m a passionate <strong>volleyball player</strong>, an experience that sharpened
            my teamwork, discipline, and leadership skills.
